                                    This step uses a community conversation model aligned with Step One. Called the <dfn>BridgeBuilder Process</dfn>
                                , it uses Stage One findings as a discussion platform for facilitated face-to-face community conversations that maximize community ownership.
                            <p>Participants discuss the community assessment findings, reacting to the results rather than to each other. The focus is on understanding the interests expressed before taking positions.</p>
                                <p>Participants are encouraged to add further value by finding agreement on possible &quot;Next Steps&quot; or other community-building strategies emerging from the findings.</p>
